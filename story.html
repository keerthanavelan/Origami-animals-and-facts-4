                Mississippi's Governor Andrew H. Longino had invited him, but unlike other hunters in the group, 
                Theodore had not located a single bear. Roosevelt's assistants, led by Holt Collier, a 
                born slave and former Confederate cavalryman, cornered and tied a black bear to a willow tree. 
                They summoned Roosevelt and suggested that he shoot it. 
                Viewing this as extremely unsportsmanlike, Roosevelt refused to shoot the bear. 
                The news of this event spread quickly through newspaper articles across the country. The articles recounted the story of the president who refused to shoot a bear. However, it was not just any president, it was Theodore Roosevelt the big game hunter!</p>
